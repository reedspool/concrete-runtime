# Programming Game

## Revving up
1. Install node & npm
2. npm install lodash baconjs
3. node main.js


## Goals
1. Turing Complete - Can we prove this?
2. Fun
3. Timing - Each step at the current level of interest should take the same amt of time
4. Memory - Leave the memory hanging out, show where stuff comes in
5. Characters - Anthropomorphizing 

## Things to Implement
+ - * / % floor sin PI
0 1 2 3 5.12 true false
and or ? < > eq =
copy{-2} copy{A} goto{B}
_ 2#index
"Hello World!" print append .

### Next steps
* read text input from STDIN
* Read arguments from STDIN
* Implement naming
* Separate logging timing of side effects/outputs from daemon movement
* Make a block registry and factory
* Separate daemon impl
* Make a package.json file with dependencies and description
* Take out extraneous requires
* Make a more rigorous typing system for Blocks
* Implement strings
* Implement folds and calling

### Future
* IMMUTABLES!!! IMMUTABLE UNIVERSES!!!!
* More variety of side effects
